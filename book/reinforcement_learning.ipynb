    "At the very core of the nature of learning is the idea of interacting with the environment. This interaction produces a wealth of information about cause and effect relationships and consequences of actions. Such as an infant doing absolutely anything without the help of a teacher. but in this process it learns the world around it, learns to walk and talk and etc. with just the sensorimotor connection to its environment. For example, driving a car, we seek to improve by being aware of how the environment responds to the actions we take. This is the foundation for learning and intelligence. The compitational approach to learning from interaction and various methods involved is called **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. This is a goal directed learning process as compared to other machine learning approaches such as the widely used supervised learning. We will discuss this later in the book."

    "\n",
    "* **Policy**: This defines a learning agent's way of behaving at a given time. It is a mapping from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states. In psychology we call this stimulus-response associations. A policy can be a simple look up table or a complex function approximator such as a neural network. The policy can be deterministic (based on rules) or stochastic (random i.e probabilities for each action given the state or situation.). In normal systems, the rules never change so the behavior is deterministic. But in most other systems, you want to explore other possibilities and to introduce this randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reward Signal**: This defines the goal of the reinforcement learning problem. At each time step, the environment sends a single number called reward. the agent's sole objective is to maximize the total reward it receives over the long run. this of this as the experiences of pleasure and pain in a biological ystem. **This is the primary basis of altering the policy**. If an action selected by the policy is followed by low reward then the policy may be changed to select some other action in that situation in future.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Value Function**: A reward signal indicates what is good in an immediate sense, a value function specifies what is good in the long run. Roughly speaking, the value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting\n",
    "from that state. Rewards determine the **immediate desirability** of a state, values indicate the **long-term desirability** of a state taking into account the states that are likely to follow and the rewards available in those states. \n",

    "Rewards are in a sense primary, whereas values, as predictions of rewards, are secondary. Without rewards there could be no values, and the only purpose of estimating values is to achieve more reward. Although, action choices are made based on value judgments, because accumulated rewards provide greatest amount of reward for us over long term than immediate rewards. Values must be estimated and re-estimated from the sequences of observations an agent makes over its entire lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **State**: The situation or information the agen is in at a given time about the environment. The state signal provides a sense of how the environment is at a given time. For example, in a chess game, the state is the current position of the pieces on the board. In a driving game, the state is the current position of the car, its speed, and other relevant information about the environment."
